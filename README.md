# Weather Application ‚òÅÔ∏èüå¶Ô∏è

## Overview

This Weather Application is a simple yet effective console application that retrieves the current temperature in fahrenheit for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
Developed using .NET Core and C#, the application demonstrates my skills in API integration, data manipulation, and working with external libraries.

## Features

- **City-Based Weather Information:** Enter the name of a city, and the application fetches and displays the current weather details.
- **OpenWeatherMap API Integration:** Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to gather real-time weather data.
- **Data Parsing with Newtonsoft.Json:** Leverages the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package for seamless parsing of JSON responses from the API.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET Core:** The application is built on the .NET Core framework, ensuring platform independence and scalability.
- **C#:** The primary programming language used for application logic and implementation.
- **Newtonsoft.Json NuGet Package:** Employed for efficient handling of JSON data.
